# Crime_visualization and Model using Tensorflow
The San Francisco Crime dataset provides a special opportunity to play with data visually. As a hobbyist photographer, I am a big fan of pretty pictures. Since the dataset covers a wide variety of crimes, visualizing them all at once might wash out any patterns contained in smaller subgroups. 
The model was made using TensorFlow and the log loss achieved was 26.9
